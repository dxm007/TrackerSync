         "closed" than Trello itself.  "Closed" issue is one that was addressed. It still shows up in the UI but
         in a list designated for closed issues (e.g. list name "Completed").  In Trello "closed" means that the
         card is to be archived and should no longer be displayed in the UI.  This utility does not archive cards nor
         does it access those cards that have been archived in Trello. -->
